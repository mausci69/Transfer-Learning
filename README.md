# Transfer-Learning

In this assignment, we will use the Dogs vs Cats dataset, which was used for a 2013 Kaggle competition. It consists of 25000 images containing either a cat or a 
dog. We will only use a subset of 600 images and labels. The dataset is a subset of a much larger dataset of 3 million photos that were originally used as a 
CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart), referred to as “Asirra” or Animal Species Image Recognition for Restricting 
Access.
Our goal is to train a classifier model using part of a pre-trained image classifier, using the principle of transfer learning.
